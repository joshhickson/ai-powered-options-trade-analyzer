1. Your Loan.

a. Loan Closing and Funding Conditions. Your Loan is closed-end credit provided to you for personal, family or household purposes and is secured by the Collateral defined herein. You agree that you will not use any portion of your Loan to pay for, finance, or refinance any postsecondary education (higher education) expenses (including without limitation tuition, room, board, books, supplies, or other postsecondary education-related expenses). By electronically signing and returning this Agreement to us, you accept the terms of the Loan that we offer to you. (Section 12 below has provisions concerning your ability to reject Section 12 (Arbitration Agreement).) Your Loan will be originated upon the later of your acceptance of this Agreement or your satisfaction of any applicable closing conditions, including depositing sufficient Collateral such that the LTV Baseline Ratio is met, provided that you must satisfy all such closing conditions no later than 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time of the fifth calendar day after the date on which you executed this Agreement.

b. Loan Disbursement. Following your timely acceptance of this Agreement, and your satisfaction of applicable closing conditions, if any, we will originate your Loan. To disburse Loan proceeds to you, you authorize us to initiate an ACH credit of Loan proceeds to your Checking Account (defined in Section 3.b.). If we make an error in initiating any ACH credit to your Checking Account, you authorize us to initiate ACH credits or debits to correct the error.

For Florida residents only: You agree that the principal amount of this Loan includes any Florida documentary stamp tax to be paid by Lender to the Florida Department of Revenue in connection with this Agreement. Any such amount will be included as part of the total principal amount owed in connection with this Loan for all purposes, including the accrual of interest on unpaid principal.

c. Term. The length of your Loan is 12 months from the date we initiate the ACH credit to your Checking Account of Loan proceeds, as described in Section 1.b. ("Term").

d. Monthly Payment Due Dates. Monthly payments of interest (see Section 3 below) will commence approximately one month (approximately thirty (30) days) after we disburse the Loan as described in Section 1.b. Subsequent monthly payments will be due on the same day of each following month. (However, if the first payment due date falls on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, any required monthly payment due in a subsequent shorter month will be due on the first day of the month following the shorter month).

e. Statements. We will send or make available to you (through your Online Account with us) monthly statements showing the amount of the monthly payment that is due, the payment due date, any monthly payments received by us in the monthly period covered by the statements, the unpaid principal balance, the interest rate, and other information, at least fourteen (14) calendar days before the

Page 2 of 19

next scheduled monthly payment due date. You agree to promptly review each monthly statement and notify Lender in writing or electronically (using the address Lender provides you for this purpose) if you have any questions. Your failure to receive a monthly statement does not relieve you of your obligation to make all required monthly payments in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2. Interest and Fees.

a. Interest Rate and Accrual. You agree to pay periodic interest on the unpaid principal balance at the Applicable Rate until the total principal amount of this Loan has been paid in full. Interest will accrue for each day principal remains outstanding under this Loan. The daily interest rate for each day will be equal to the Applicable Rate for such day divided by 365 (366 in any leap year). Because we calculate interest daily, the amount of interest you pay will vary based on the number of days between your previous payment and your current payment. Late payments will result in more interest accruing.

b. Origination Fee. When you obtain the Loan, you agree to pay us an origination fee equal to $300.00. You agree that the origination fee will be included as part of the total principal amount owed in connection with this Loan for all purposes, including the accrual of interest on unpaid principal. We will treat the origination fee as disbursed directly to us when we disburse Loan proceeds to your Checking Account, as described in Section 1.b. You agree that the loan origination fee is fully earned by us and nonrefundable when we disburse the Amount Financed of the Loan to you or to public officials on your behalf, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.

As used in this Agreement:

"Applicable Rate" means, for any date, a yearly rate equal to 12.615%. The Applicable Rate will not change during the term of the Loan.

3. Payments.

a. Promise to Pay. You agree to pay all amounts you owe us under this Agreement, including all monthly payments, whether due and payable or deferred (collectively, "Balance") when due. You must make all required monthly payments of interest ("Monthly Payment") and all other payments hereunder when due hereunder in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Section 3.

b Payments Generally. All payments due from you to us hereunder shall be made by bank wire, automated clearing house (ACH), or the proceeds of the sale of Collateral, as set forth below:

i Payments made by bank wire shall be made to Lender's account at JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, NA bearing Account Number 705191069 and Routing Number 21000021. Payments made by ACH shall be made from a valid checking account ("Checking Account") at a U.S. financial institution that you designate (whether at time of application, or through your Online Account with us or as part of your voluntary autopay authorization). If you pay off the entire balance of your loan using ACH, the Collateral shall be returned twenty-one (21) days after we receive your final payment to the Digital Currency Address you have specified to us, and if you pay off the entire balance of your loan using bank wire, the Collateral shall be returned within three (3) days after we receive your final payment to the Digital Currency Address you have specified to us.

ii. Payments made by the proceeds of the sale of Collateral shall, subject to Section 5.c., be made by Lender liquidating, at your written direction or at Lender's election when permitted under this Agreement, a portion of the Collateral having a Collateral Market Value (i) in an amount necessary to make such payment and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Balance, and (ii) of

Page 3 of 19

an additional processing fee equivalent to two percent (2%) of such payment amount. If you pay off the entire balance of your loan with the proceeds of such Collateral, any remaining Collateral shall be returned within three (3) days after we receive your final payment to the Digital Currency Address you have specified to us.

You may change your Checking Account by updating your preferences in your Online Account. Changes must be made at least three (3) Business Days before any scheduled payment. If you voluntarily choose to give us an autopay authorization, you can view, change, or cancel the autopay authorization in your Online Account. If you want to change or cancel a scheduled autopay payment or recurring autopay authorization, you must do so at least three (3) Business Days before the next due date for payment hereunder. We do not accept payments in the form of paper check or through third party bill payment services. We are not responsible for payment delays that may occur as a result of bank holidays, the processing schedule of your bank, bank processing errors, or other events beyond our control.

As used in this Agreement:

"Digital Currency Address" means an identifier of 26-42 alphanumeric characters (or such other market-standard identifier) that represents a possible destination for a transfer of Eligible Digital Currency.

"Eligible Digital Currency" means Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH).

"Eligible Stablecoin" means USD Coin (USDC).

c. Monthly Payments. THIS CONTRACT IS NOT PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS OF EQUAL AMOUNTS: AN INSTALLMENT OF $30,300.00, AND ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS OWING HEREUNDER, WILL BE DUE ON THE MATURITY DATE. Your Monthly Payment will consist only of accrued interest on the principal amount of this Loan and will not amortize any portion of the principal amount of this Loan. The entire principal amount of this Loan, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing hereunder, will be due and payable approximately 12 months after we disburse the Loan (the "Maturity Date"), unless earlier accelerated pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

d Calculation of Payment Amounts. The exact Monthly Payment amount will depend on when we disburse the Loan as described in Section 1.b. The monthly payments, Finance Charge, and Total of Payments shown in the Truth in Lending Disclosures are estimates. The dollar amount of the final Monthly Payment also will depend on the actual number of days between your previous payments and your final payment as described in Section 2.a., and will be in addition to any other amounts necessary to repay your Balance in full.

Without losing any of our rights under this Agreement, we may accept late or partial payments. Our acceptance of partial payments does not change your obligation to pay us all amounts you owe us under this Agreement when due. You will not send partial payments marked "paid in full," "without recourse" or with other similar language, and we may disregard any such language accompanying any partial payment.

For the avoidance of doubt, if you fail to make any required Monthly Payment within thirty (30) days of its due date, Lender may immediately liquidate a portion of the Collateral having a Collateral Market Value in an amount necessary to make such payment and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of such Monthly Payment, with any excess proceeds from such liquidation to be applied to the repayment of the Balance in such manner as determined by Lender in its sole discretion.

Page 4 of 19

e. Final Maturity Date Payment. You agree to pay the entire principal amount of the Loan and all accrued and unpaid interest at the rate expressed herein on the Maturity Date, unless earlier accelerated pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

f Prepayment. You may prepay any portion of your Balance any time before it is due without penalty. When you make a prepayment you agree to tell us in writing that you are doing so. You may not designate and we will not consider a payment as a prepayment if you have not made all scheduled payments then due under the Loan. Any partial prepayment will not excuse you from continuing to pay the required payments when due hereunder in their scheduled amounts, unless we specifically agree otherwise in writing.

g. Application of Payments. Payments (including partial payments) are credited to your Loan as of the Business Day they are received, if we receive your payment before 10:00 p.m. Pacific Time on that Business Day. Payments received at or after 10:00 p.m. Pacific Time on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day may be credited to your Loan as of the next Business Day. To the extent permitted by applicable law, payments (including partial payments) are applied first to all interest that has accrued on unpaid principal as of the Business Day the payment is credited, and then to the unpaid principal balance owed on this Loan.

4. Grant of Security Interest; Collateral Matters. For valuable consideration, the adequacy and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, you hereby:

a. pledge and deliver to Lender, and grant to Lender a continuing and unconditional first priority security interest in, the following (collectively referred to as the "Collateral") as security for the payment of the Balance and performance of all other obligations under this Agreement:

ii. all cryptocurrency now or in the future held in, on deposit in or otherwise allocated to the Collateral Account (including, without limitation, any cryptocurrency transferred to the Collateral Account after the date hereof by you pursuant to Section 5 or otherwise);

Page 5 of 19

g. agree that Lender may change the location of the Custodian and Collateral Account without notice to you.

h. agree that the holding of Collateral through the Custodian constitutes the use of reasonable care with respect to the custody and preservation of the Collateral; and

i agree to pay any and all withholding taxes applicable to the Collateral and all payment made hereunder, including any withholding taxes on any amounts so paid and, upon written request by Lender, shall furnish Lender with evidence of payment thereof.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings provided by the UCC to the extent such terms are defined therein.

5. Valuation; Additional Collateral.

Page 6 of 19

b. Additional Collateral. To induce Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loan, you hereby covenant that you will, at all times, maintain an LTV Ratio of less than or equal to the LTV Baseline Ratio; provided that the LTV Ratio shall be less than or equal to the LTV Baseline Ratio as of the date of disbursement of the Loan.

i. Lender agrees to notify you of the occurrence of any event where Lender becomes aware that the LTV Ratio is greater than or equal to 85%; provided that any failure by Lender to provide such notification shall not in any way limit any of your obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, your obligations set forth in this Section 5 to maintain an LTV Ratio of less than or equal to the LTV Baseline Ratio);

ii. When notice is provided by Lender to you of the occurrence of a Trigger Event (hereinafter defined), you shall promptly, and in any event no later than the applicable Cure Time, transfer additional Collateral consisting of Eligible Digital Currency to the Collateral Account and/or prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Loan in such an amount as is necessary to cause the LTV Ratio to be equal to or less than the LTV Baseline Ratio.

c. Liquidation.

i If you fail to perform your obligations set forth in Section 5.b. prior to the applicable Cure Time, Lender may immediately liquidate Collateral, without any notice except as required by law, in such an amount as necessary to cause the LTV Ratio to be equal to or less than the LTV Baseline Ratio.

ii. If at any time the LTV Ratio is greater than or equal to 90% (the "Accelerated Maximum LTV Ratio"), to the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender has the right to immediately liquidate all Collateral, without any notice except as required by law.

iii. Any Collateral liquidated by Lender is subject to a two percent (2.00%) processing fee, except if your address shown on the first page of this Agreement is in Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, or Wisconsin, in which case there is no processing fee.

d. Collateral Release. If there is a sufficient excess of collateral, you may request for Collateral, in the amount of that excess, to be released to you. If your Release LTV Ratio is less than thirty-five percent (35%) for seven consecutive calendar days, you may request for Collateral to be released to you in an amount sufficient to return the Release LTV Ratio to thirty-five percent (35)%.

In the event of eligibility for release of Collateral, you may submit to us a written request for release. Our approval of a request for release will not be unreasonably withheld, will be conditioned on the LTV Ratio remaining below thirty-five percent (35%) through the date of release and for the prior seven consecutive calendar days, and will be in compliance with all applicable laws, specifically including any applicable anti-money laundering laws. The amount of Collateral that is released will be determined based on the lower of the Collateral Market Value at the time of release or the average Collateral Market Value over the seven calendar days prior to the date of the release.

7. Default. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you will be in default and Lender shall have the right to cancel any scheduled Loan disbursement not yet made and to declare the whole Balance to be due and payable at once (this is called "acceleration"), subject to any applicable law which may give you a right to cure your default, if: (1) You fail to make any required payment on the Maturity Date or such other date when such payment becomes due hereunder, unless, solely in the case of a Monthly Payment

Page 8 of 19

with a due date prior to the Maturity Date, such payment is made within thirty (30) days of such due date; or (2) You fail to notify us in writing of a change in your name or address (including e-mail address) within ten (10) days after a change occurs; or (3) You become the subject of proceedings under the United States Bankruptcy Code or assign your assets for the benefit of your creditors; or (4) You break any of your other agreements in this Agreement; or (5) You make any false, misleading or materially incomplete statement in applying for this Loan; or (6) You die; or (7) You notify us of your inability to or your intention not to perform any of your obligations hereunder or otherwise disaffirm, reject or repudiate any of your obligations hereunder; or (8) a Trigger Event occurs and is continuing and you fail to transfer additional Collateral as required pursuant to Section 5; or (9) the LTV Ratio is greater than or equal to the Accelerated Maximum LTV Ratio; or (10) any of your creditors or any governmental agency commences foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, against any Collateral securing the Loan, or (11) there occurs a general suspension in buying, selling or owning any Eligible Digital Currency included in the Collateral by U.S. federal governmental authorities or a suspension in buying, selling or owning digital assets or cryptocurrencies on the Liquidity Exchange, with such disruption lasting five (5) days or more.

8. Remedies. If you are in default, we may accelerate the payment of the Balance due (as described above), subject to any notice and/or right to cure you may have under applicable law, and we may accrue interest on the full Balance due at the interest rate shown in Section 2.a. unless applicable law requires a lower interest rate. If you are in default, we are not required to agree to any extension of a due date for payment or to any refinancing of the Balance due. If you are in default, we shall have all other rights and remedies of a lender under the UCC or as otherwise provided under applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you expressly agree that in any such default, subject to any right to cure provided by applicable law, we may take immediate and exclusive possession of the Collateral and that we may liquidate the Collateral in whole or in part, at our sole discretion, where permitted by applicable law. If you do not meet your obligations under this Agreement, you may lose the Collateral.

We are not required to make any demand upon you, send you any notice, present this Agreement to you for payment or make protest of non-payment to you before or when we accelerate the payment of the Balance due or sue to collect this Loan if you are in default, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby waive any right you might otherwise have to require such actions or to receive any such notice (including without limitation notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration).

b. Agreement; and To Lender in an amount equal to any outstanding and unpaid Balance under this

any remaining surplus to you or any other secured party, as applicable, in accordance with the UCC or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

The rights of us and each of our affiliates under this paragraph are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set- off) that we or such affiliate may have. We agree to notify you promptly after such set off and appropriation and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and appropriation and application. Subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this final paragraph of this Section 8 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of 12 months after such expiration or termination.

9. Lender Appointed Attorney-In-Fact. You hereby appoint Lender as your attorney-in-fact, with

full authority in your place and stead and in your name or otherwise, from time to time while you are in default under this Agreement to take any action and to execute any instrument that Lender may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, except for a confession of judgment, for receipt of service of process, or to appear on your behalf in a judicial proceeding (but Lender shall not be obligated to and shall have no liability to you or any third party for failure to do so or take action). This appointment, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable. You hereby ratify all that said attorney-in-fact shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. If your state of residence is Rhode Island, you hereby appoint Lender as your attorney-in-fact solely for the purpose of executing a statutory power of sale.

10. Security Interest Absolute. To the extent permitted by law, you hereby waive demand, notice, protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, Collateral received or delivered and all other demands and notices of any description.

a. Unless your state of residence is Alabama as shown on the first page of this Agreement, any illegality or lack of validity or enforceability of the Balance or your other obligations hereunder or any related agreement or instrument;

b. any change in the time, place or manner of payment of, or in any other term of, the Balance, or any amendment or other modification of this Agreement or any other agreement, including any increase in the Balance resulting from any extension of additional credit or otherwise;

Unless your state of residence is Alabama as shown on the first page of this Agreement, any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or manner of administering the Loan or any existence of or reliance on any representation by Lender that might vary your risk or otherwise operate as a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, you or any guarantor or surety.

11. Reporting of Credit Information. We may report information about your Loan to credit reporting agencies (credit bureaus). A negative report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to a credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill your credit obligation terms. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Loan may be reflected in your credit report. If you believe we have inaccurately reported information about you or your Loan to a credit reporting agency (credit bureau), you may write to us at Figure Lending LLC, 650 S.

Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. This Section 12 is an agreement to arbitrate Claims (as defined below) that may arise as a result of the Loan or this Agreement. Read this agreement to arbitrate carefully. If a dispute arises that is covered by this agreement to arbitrate, you may be required to settle the dispute through binding arbitration. This means that you will not be able to have the dispute settled by trial or before a jury. Other rights that you would have if you went to court may not be available or may be more limited in arbitration, including your right to appeal.

This Section 12 does not apply to you if and for as long as you are a "Covered Borrower," as that term is defined in 32 CFR Section 232.3(g).

In consideration for our willingness to extend you the Loan described in this Agreement, you and we agree as follows:

Any claim, dispute or controversy ("Claim") by either you or us against the other arising from or relating in any way to this Agreement or your Loan, shall, at the demand of any party, be resolved by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge. However, we will not demand arbitration pursuant to this agreement to arbitrate in connection with any individual Claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims or comparable court of your state or municipality, so long as the individual Claim is pending only in that court. "Binding arbitration" means an arbitration proceeding according to the rules of either JAMS or the American Arbitration Association (each referred to herein as the "Arbitration Association"). You may select which of these Arbitration Associations to use. If you fail to select the Arbitration Association within 45 days from either the date we receive from you a demand for arbitration or the date you receive from us a demand for arbitration, we will choose one. Any arbitration proceeding will take place at a location within the federal judicial district that includes your residence address in our records for your Loan at the time the Claim is filed or at any other mutually acceptable location. Any party to the arbitration proceeding may enter judgment upon the arbitration award in any court having jurisdiction over the arbitration award and may have that judgment enforced by any court having jurisdiction over that judgment.

A demand for arbitration under this agreement to arbitrate may be made either before or after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding begins. Neither you nor we waive the right to arbitrate by filing suit or seeking or obtaining provisional remedies from a court. However, any demand for arbitration that is made after a lawsuit or other legal proceeding has begun must be made within 90 days following the service of a complaint, third-party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.

This agreement to arbitrate includes all controversies and disputes of any kind between or among us. It also includes any disputes you have with our agents, contractors, employees, officers or assignees or any other third party that has been involved or becomes involved with, any activity relating to your Loan or this Agreement (including any such third party that has not signed this Agreement), and for purposes of this agreement to arbitrate the words "we," "us" and "our" include any and all such third parties.

The Claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate include, without limitation:

Any disputes regarding the enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate or any other aspect of this entire Agreement;

Any disputes regarding: the application you submitted in connection with this Loan; any solicitation or advertising materials or disclosures you received in connection with this Loan; your acceptance of this Loan; any activities, action or inaction relating to the disbursement, maintenance or servicing of your Loan (whether based on statute, contract, tort or any other legal theory); and any funds held by us in connection with your Loan;

Any disputes arising from the collection of amounts you owe in connection with your Loan;

Any disputes regarding information obtained by us from, or reported by us to, credit bureaus or others.

IMPORTANT WAIVERS: IF EITHER YOU OR WE CHOOSE ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES, OR OTHERWISE TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN ANY COURT (OTHER THAN IN AN ACTION TO ENFORCE THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD).

FURTHER, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST US MAY NOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY OTHER PERSON. (THIS IS CALLED THE "CLASS ACTION WAIVER.")

OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

GOVERNING LAW: You and we each agree that the transactions subject to this agreement to arbitrate involve interstate commerce. Consequently, this agreement to arbitrate shall be governed solely by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 USC Section 1 et seq.

The cost of any arbitration proceeding shall be divided as follows:

The party requesting the arbitration proceeding shall pay to the Arbitration Association an amount up to $200.00 when the demand for arbitration is made;

Page 12 of 19

We will pay to the Arbitration Association all other costs for the arbitration proceeding up to a maximum of one day (eight hours) of hearings;

All costs of the arbitration proceeding that exceed one day of hearings will be paid by the non-prevailing party unless otherwise required by applicable rules of the Arbitration Association, applicable law, or by the arbitrator's decision; and

Each party shall pay its own attorney, expert and witness fees and expenses, unless otherwise required by law or by the arbitrator's decision.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you believe the cost of arbitration may be too burdensome, you may seek a waiver of the filing fee and any other charges of the Arbitration Association under applicable rules of the Arbitration Association. If you seek, but do not qualify for such a waiver, we will consider a written request from you to advance all or part of the filing fee.

The arbitrator will be required to follow relevant law and applicable judicial precedent to arrive at a decision, and all applicable statutes of limitation. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award in favor of the individual party seeking relief all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages (subject to constitutional limits that would apply in court), and attorneys' fees and costs (subject to any applicable limits that would apply in court). In addition, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted in that party's individual Claim. If the arbitrator determines that any Claim or defense is frivolous or wrongfully intended to oppress the other party, the arbitrator may award sanctions in the form of fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the other party (including arbitration administration fees, arbitrator's fees, and attorney, expert and witness fees), to the extent such fees and expenses could be imposed under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall include a concise explanation of the basis of the arbitrator's decision. The arbitrator's decision shall become final and binding after 30 days unless you or we take an appeal from the decision by making a written request to the Arbitration Association. The appeal panel, which will consist of three arbitrators who shall be attorneys or retired judges, will consider all factual and legal issues anew, will conduct the appeal in the same manner as the initial arbitration, and will make decisions based on the vote of the majority. The party requesting the appeal shall pay all costs of the appeal process, except that each party shall pay its own attorney, expert and witness fees and expenses unless otherwise required by law. The panel's decision shall be final and binding, and shall be in writing and include a concise explanation of the basis of the panel's decision.

The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator's or panel's decision, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration proceeding on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an arbitration decision or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

Unless properly rejected by you as described below, this agreement to arbitrate shall survive full payment of the Loan, our sale or transfer of the Loan, any bankruptcy or insolvency, any forbearance or modification of the Loan, and any termination of the Loan or this Agreement.

If any provision of this agreement to arbitrate other than the Class Action Waiver described above should be found invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, such a determination shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Section 12, which shall remain and continue in full force and effect. However, if the Class Action Waiver described above is found by a court or arbitrator to be unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement to arbitrate shall be unenforceable.

13. Other Terms and Conditions.

a. Applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, this Agreement, and any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) at any time arising from or relating to this Agreement, is governed by and construed in accordance with applicable United States federal law and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, (i) if you are a resident of the United States, the laws of the state of your residence at the time you sign this Agreement ("State of Residence") even if you move from that state, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; or (ii) if you are not a resident of the United States, the laws of the State of North Carolina shall apply, except that Chapter 24 of the North Carolina General Statutes shall not apply and the relevant laws of the State of Delaware shall apply instead thereof.

However, the agreement to arbitrate (see Section 12 above) is governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 USC Section 1 et seq. and not by any state law.

b. Severability.

However, all remaining contract terms and provisions not proscribed or prohibited shall remain in full force and effect.
