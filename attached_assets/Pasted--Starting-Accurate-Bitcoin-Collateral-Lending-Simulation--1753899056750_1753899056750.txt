🎲 Monte Carlo Run #3: 5.7% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
✅ Model will sample from actual historical distribution instead of assumptions
💰 Initial loan amount: $11,657
🪙 Initial collateral: 0.1440 BTC
📉 Expected worst drawdown: 2.0%

🔍 STRATEGY VIABILITY CHECK:
   Status: ❌ NOT VIABLE
   Reason: Max safe loan $3,186 below minimum $10,000
   Recommendation: Need at least 0.706 BTC for viable strategy

💡 VIABLE PARAMETER SUGGESTIONS:
============================================================

1. Increase Starting Capital:
   Starting BTC: 0.856 BTC ($101,033)
   Goal BTC: 1.00 BTC
   Description: Need 0.856 BTC ($101,033) to safely reach 1.0 BTC goal

2. Lower Goal (with 0.5 BTC capital):
   Starting BTC: 0.500 BTC ($59,000)
   Goal BTC: 0.81 BTC
   Description: With 0.5 BTC, realistically achieve ~0.81 BTC goal

3. Lower Goal (with 0.75 BTC capital):
   Starting BTC: 0.750 BTC ($88,500)
   Goal BTC: 1.29 BTC
   Description: With 0.75 BTC, realistically achieve ~1.29 BTC goal

4. Dollar Cost Averaging Alternative:
   Starting BTC: 0.240 BTC ($28,320)
   Goal BTC: 1.00 BTC
   Description: DCA $1000/month would reach goal in 118.0 months with less risk

🔧 TO TEST A SUGGESTION:
   1. Edit the 'Starting conditions' section in main()
   2. Update start_btc and/or btc_goal values
   3. Re-run the simulation
