📈 Tier 2: Trying Kraken API...
✅ Kraken successful: 720 days
📊 Loaded 720 days of price data
📈 Analyzed 516 historical recovery cycles
📊 Using conservative drawdown model based on Bitcoin crash history
📈 Historical data shows:
   • Worst observed drawdown: 26.2%
   • 95th percentile drawdown: 22.2%
💡 Conservative model at $60,714: expects 82.5% maximum drawdown
⚠️  Conservative model predicts worse crashes: 82.5%
   This is intentional for risk management
💡 Conservative model at $118,000: expects 86.2% maximum drawdown
💰 Initial loan amount: $10,000
🪙 Initial collateral: 0.1200 BTC
📉 Expected worst drawdown: 86.2%
💡 Conservative model at $118,000: expects 86.2% maximum drawdown
🎲 Simulating realistic outcomes for 6-month cycle starting at $118,000
🎲 Selected scenario: sideways - Choppy sideways movement
   Outcome: BREAK_EVEN, Price: $113,158
📊 Cycle 1: $113,158 → $113,158, BTC: 0.1031, Strategy: monthly_payments
💡 Conservative model at $113,158: expects 86.2% maximum drawdown
🎲 Simulating realistic outcomes for 6-month cycle starting at $113,158
🎲 Selected scenario: decline - Gradual decline
