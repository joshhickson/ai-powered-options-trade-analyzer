📈 Tier 2: Trying Kraken API...
✅ Kraken successful: 720 days
📊 Loaded 720 days of price data
📈 Analyzed 516 historical recovery cycles
📊 Using data-driven drawdown model based on actual Bitcoin history
📈 Historical data analysis:
   • Worst observed drawdown: 26.2%
   • 95th percentile drawdown: 22.2%
   • Mean drawdown: 8.4%
   • Median drawdown: 7.1%
🎲 Data-driven model sampling from 516 historical cycles at $60,714:
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #1: 2.0% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #2: 4.8% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #3: 2.0% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
✅ Model will sample from actual historical distribution instead of assumptions
