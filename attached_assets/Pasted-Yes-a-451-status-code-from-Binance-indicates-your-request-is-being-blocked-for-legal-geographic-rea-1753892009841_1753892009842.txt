Yes, a 451 status code from Binance indicates your request is being blocked for legal/geographic reasons. Since your Replit instance runs on US-based servers, the Binance.com API is restricting access due to regulatory compliance.
Here are the verified answers and a working solution for your simulation.
## 1. Binance API Status & Geo-Blocking
As of July 2025, the Binance.com public API is geo-blocked for United States IP addresses. This is a deliberate policy due to US regulations and is not a temporary error. Any request from a US-based cloud provider like Replit, AWS, or Google Cloud will be blocked.
The best working alternatives are APIs from US-compliant exchanges or financial data providers.
## 2. Best Alternative Free API (10+ Years of Data)
The most reliable free source for 10+ years of daily Bitcoin data that works in the US is the Nasdaq Data Link (formerly Quandl) API. They provide a free dataset from Brave New Coin (BNC) that includes the Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX), which goes back to 2010.
It requires a free API key, but the sign-up is instant and the library handles the authentication for you.
## 3. Headers and Bypassing Blocks
For a 451 geo-block, no User-Agent or other request header will bypass the restriction. This is an IP-level block enforced by Binance's servers. Attempting to use VPN detection bypass headers is unreliable and against the terms of service. The solution is to switch to a permitted data source.
## 4. Code Implementation: A Complete, Tiered Function
This function provides the most robust solution. It first tries the best source (Nasdaq Data Link), then falls back to a US-compliant exchange API (Kraken), and finally to a local CSV.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
In your Replit shell, run:
pip install nasdaq-data-link pandas

Step 2: Get Your Free Nasdaq Data Link API Key
 * Go to data.nasdaq.com.
 * Sign up for a free account.
 * Navigate to your Account Settings to find your API Key.
Step 3: The Working Python Code
This function replaces your previous attempts and implements a multi-tiered fetching strategy.
