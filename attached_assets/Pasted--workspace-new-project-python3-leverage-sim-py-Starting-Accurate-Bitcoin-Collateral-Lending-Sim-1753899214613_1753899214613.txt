📈 Tier 2: Trying Kraken API...
✅ Kraken successful: 720 days
📊 Loaded 720 days of price data
📈 Analyzed 516 historical recovery cycles
📊 Using data-driven drawdown model based on actual Bitcoin history
📈 Historical data analysis:
   • Worst observed drawdown: 26.2%
   • 95th percentile drawdown: 22.2%
   • Mean drawdown: 8.4%
   • Median drawdown: 7.1%
🎲 Data-driven model sampling from 516 historical cycles at $60,714:
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #1: 4.5% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #2: 4.4% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
🎲 Monte Carlo Run #3: 20.9% drawdown at $60,714
   Scenario: Historical data sample
✅ Model will sample from actual historical distribution instead of assumptions
💰 Initial loan amount: $22,339
🪙 Initial collateral: 0.3000 BTC
📉 Expected worst drawdown: 9.8%

🔍 STRATEGY VIABILITY CHECK:
   Status: ✅ VIABLE
   Reason: Estimated 5.9 cycles, 2.4% annual interest burden
   Recommendation: Proceed with caution. Max safe loan: $12,390
🎲 Simulating realistic outcomes for 6-month cycle starting at $118,000
🎲 Cycle 1: Selected scenario: decline - Gradual decline
   Random value: 0.917, Probability: 20.0%
   Outcome: LIQUIDATION, Price: $101,767
💥 LIQUIDATION in cycle 1 - simulation terminated
