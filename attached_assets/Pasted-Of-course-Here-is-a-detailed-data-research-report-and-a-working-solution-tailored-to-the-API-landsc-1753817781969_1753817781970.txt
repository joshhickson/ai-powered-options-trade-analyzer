Of course. Here is a detailed data research report and a working solution tailored to the API landscape of January 2025.
Your diagnosis is correct. Both yfinance's crypto data feeds remain unreliable, and CoinGecko has indeed updated its API policy, effectively ending unauthenticated access to its historical data endpoints.
Here is a breakdown of the current situation and the best path forward.
Current API Landscape (January 2025)
 * CoinGecko API Fix:
   * Policy Change: As of late 2024 / early 2025, CoinGecko now requires an API key for nearly all endpoints, including historical market charts. The 401 Unauthorized error confirms this.
   * Solution: You must use their free "Demo" plan. Go to the CoinGecko API page, sign up, and you will be issued a key. This plan is generous, offering 10,000 calls per month.
   * Implementation: The key is passed as a URL query parameter: x_cg_demo_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY.
 * Best Working Public API (No Key): Binance
   * The Binance Public API remains the most reliable and accessible source for historical crypto data that does not require an API key for its public endpoints.
   * The klines (candlestick) endpoint is stable and provides up to 1,000 data points per request. This meets your requirement for 1,000+ days of data.
Recommended Solution: Binance API
This approach is simple, robust, requires no authentication, and is the most reliable free method available today.
1. Dependency Installation
You will need the requests library. For a more advanced and flexible solution (covered in the alternatives), ccxt is recommended.
In your Replit "Shell" tab:
pip install requests pandas

2. Complete Python Code with Fallback
This updated load_btc_history function prioritizes the key-less Binance API and includes robust error handling.
import pandas as pd
import requests
import time
from typing import Optional

def load_btc_history() -> Optional[pd.Series]:
    """
    Fetches daily Bitcoin closing prices using the most reliable 2025 methods.

    Tier 1: Attempts to fetch data from the Binance public API (no key needed).
    Tier 2: If Binance fails, falls back to the Coinbase public API (no key needed).
    Tier 3: If both APIs fail, falls back to a local 'btc_history_backup.csv'.

    Returns:
        A pandas Series with daily closing prices indexed by date,
        or None if all methods fail.

Rate Limiting and Best Practices
 * Set a User-Agent: Some APIs block default requests or python user-agents. Disguising your request as a browser, as shown in the code, can prevent this.
 * Handle 429 Errors: A 429 Too Many Requests error means you've hit a rate limit. The best way to handle this is with an exponential backoff strategy.
Example for handling rate limits if you were making many consecutive calls:
import time

retries = 3
delay = 5  # Start with a 5-second delay
for i in range(retries):
    try:
        response = requests.get(...)
        response.raise_for_status()
        break # Success
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 429:
            print(f"Rate limit hit. Retrying in {delay} seconds...")
            time.sleep(delay)
            delay *= 2 # Exponential backoff
        else:
            raise # Re-raise other HTTP errors
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed. Retrying in {delay} seconds...")
        time.sleep(delay)

Advanced Solution: Using the ccxt Library
For a more robust and professional solution, the ccxt library is the gold standard in 2025. It's a unified wrapper around over 100 crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase. It simplifies fetching data and can handle some rate-limiting internally.
Installation:
pip install ccxt

ccxt implementation:
import ccxt
import pandas as pd

def load_btc_history_ccxt() -> Optional[pd.Series]:
    """Fetches historical data using the ccxt library."""
    print("Attempting to fetch data via ccxt from Binance...")
    try:
        exchange = ccxt.binance()
        # Fetch 1000 daily candles for BTC/USDT
        ohlcv = exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', '1d', limit=1000)
        
        df = pd.DataFrame(ohlcv, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])
        df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
        df = df.set_index('Date')
        
        return df['close']
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ ccxt failed: {e}")
        return None
