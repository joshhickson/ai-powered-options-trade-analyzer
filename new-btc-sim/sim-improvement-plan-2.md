üéØ STRATEGIC GAME PLAN: 3-Year BTC Performance Modeling
Phase 1: Historical Data Analysis & Pattern Recognition
1.1 Multi-Timeframe Analysis

Daily data: 10+ years for macro trends
Hourly data: 2+ years for volatility patterns
15-minute data: Recent months for micro-crash analysis
Focus on cycle identification (bull/bear phases, halvings)
1.2 Key Metrics to Extract

Crash Patterns: Frequency, amplitude, recovery time
Bull Run Characteristics: Duration, velocity, peak formations
Bear Market Behavior: Drawdown depth, sideways grinding periods
Volatility Regimes: High/low vol periods and transitions
Seasonal Effects: Monthly/quarterly patterns
1.3 Advanced Pattern Analysis

V-shape recovery ratios (your existing crash analysis is perfect for this)
Run-up velocity before peaks
Support/resistance level behavior
Halving cycle impacts (every 4 years)
Phase 2: Probabilistic Scenario Framework
2.1 Base Scenarios (Weighted Probabilities)

Bull Continuation (30%): Current cycle extends 12-18 months
Cycle Peak & Bear (40%): Peak in 2025, bear market 2025-2026
Extended Sideways (20%): Choppy $80K-$120K range
Black Swan Crash (10%): Major external shock scenario
2.2 Sub-Scenario Components

Peak timing distribution (Q2 2025 vs Q4 2025 vs 2026)
Peak magnitude ($150K vs $200K vs $300K+)
Bear market depth (-60% vs -80% vs -90%)
Recovery timeline (6 months vs 2 years vs longer)
Phase 3: Synthesis & Validation
3.1 Monte Carlo Integration

Run 1000+ scenarios with your historical crash data
Weight scenarios by halving cycle analysis
Include macro factors (adoption, regulation, economic cycles)
3.2 Reality Constraints

Market cap growth limits
Liquidity considerations
Institutional adoption curves
Regulatory impact modeling
Phase 4: Implementation Strategy
4.1 Data Pipeline

Kraken API for recent high-resolution data
Historical data synthesis for longer timeframes
Real-time validation against current market
4.2 Modeling Approach

Use your existing crash analysis as foundation
Implement Geometric Brownian Motion with regime switching
Add jump-diffusion for black swan events
Incorporate mean reversion for long-term cycles
4.3 Output Generation

Generate 50-100 realistic price paths
Include confidence intervals
Provide scenario probabilities
Export for strategy backtesting
üîç Key Questions to Resolve First:
Primary Use Case: Is this for your leverage strategy optimization, general investment planning, or research?

Accuracy vs Realism Trade-off: Do you want statistically rigorous models or "reasonable human intuition" scenarios?

External Factors: Should we include macro events (elections, Fed policy, adoption milestones) or purely technical analysis?

Time Granularity: Daily resolution sufficient, or do you need hourly/weekly for specific analysis?

Validation Method: How will we test if our 3-year projections are "good enough"?

üöÄ Recommended Starting Point:
I suggest we begin with your existing multi-resolution crash analysis as the foundation. Your historical data on recovery velocities and crash patterns is exactly what we need to build realistic future scenarios.

Immediate Next Steps:

Extend your crash analysis to include halving cycle context
Create probability distributions for different market phases
Build a scenario generator that respects historical patterns
Validate against recent market behavior
